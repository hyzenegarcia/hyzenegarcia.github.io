	<p>My page is about my favroite music,movies and games. All of these things I grew up with and has all meaning to my life.
		Call Of Duty 2 was my favorite game growing up because it give me nonstalgia of me and my friends hanging out at night having fun. 
		I discover them by my friend who put me on since I did not have gaming console. I enjoy the zombie game at night because  it scared me.
		My favorite movie is Space Jam because when I was a kid I wanted to dunk like Michael Jordan.
		My favotite music out of the 3 is Love Yourz it has deep meanings behind it and loving your true happiness is the biggest in life someone out theere is going to have better things than you it do not mean they are bettr than you as long as you are happy.
